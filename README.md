Illyan
======

Illyan is a central user account management application.  It has an internal store for user accounts and groups, and
presents a simple UI for users to log in, sign up, and edit their profiles.

Illyan is designed to integrate with your existing web apps.  To this end, it provides:

* An embedded Castronaut server to allow CAS-enabled apps to do single sign-on
* A RESTful API for other apps to access user account information
